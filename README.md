This code uses the OpenWeatherMap API to get weather data for a city entered by the user. It prompts the user to enter a city name and sends an HTTP request to the API to retrieve the weather information. If the city is found, it extracts the weather condition and temperature from the API response and prints them. If the city is not found, it displays a "City not found" message.
